# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format will follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format after v1.0.0 release.

For alpha version changes would be in format `v0.*.0`, since most of the changes are breaking and the project can be fully rewritten.

Alpha version changelog can be found in git commit messages:
```shell
git log --pretty=format:'[%h]%d%n%s%n%n%b===%n%n%n'
```
