**PHP**, or **Hypertext Preprocessor**, is a widely-used open-source scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML and interacts with databases to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

## PHP Features
- **Server-Side Scripting**: Executes on the server, generating HTML sent to the client's browser.
- **Database Integration**: Works seamlessly with databases like MySQL, PostgresSQL, and SQLite.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

PHP is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

Here is the code example:
```php
function templateRender(string $path, $props): string
{
    extract($props);
    ob_start();
    include $path;
    return ob_get_clean();
}
```

## Common PHP Use Cases
- **Content Management Systems _(CMS)_**: Powers platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
- **E-commerce**: Used in developing online stores and shopping carts.
- **Web Applications**: Essential for creating interactive applications like forums, social media platforms, and blogs. 

The PHP community offers extensive documentation, frameworks, and libraries, which contribute to the language's ongoing popularity and versatility in web development.
